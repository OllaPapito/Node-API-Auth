This code is about an authentication in Node JS, it is possible to create a user in the database, it allows the authentication login of the registered user, 
being logged in allows the use of a private route that returns access to the content of the database. I've done a simple code with Auth and base64 encryption, 
as well as the JWT library.

To run the code:

npm install

npm run start-dev
